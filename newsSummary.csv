"COVID-19 Risk Doesn't Depend (Much) on Blood Type, New Studies Find","But over the past few months, after looking at thousands of additional patients with COVID-19, scientists are reporting a much weaker link to blood type.
But blood type did not affect whether people would have to be placed on ventilators, or their odds of dying.
That’s because blood type influences how your immune system fights against infections.
People with Type A blood don’t make the same kind of antibodies as people with Type B blood, for example.
It’s conceivable that these molecular differences in the immune system explain the purported link between blood type and coronavirus infections.",07/22/2020
Nuclear blast sends star hurtling across galaxy,"A star has been sent hurtling across the galaxy after undergoing a partial supernova, astronomers say.
These heavier elements are normally cooked up from the lighter ones, and make up the defining features of thermonuclear supernovas.
The nature of the nuclear burning that occurs in a supernova is different from the reactions that release energy in nuclear power plants or most nuclear weapons.
Most uses of nuclear energy on Earth rely on fission - which breaks down heavier elements into lighter ones - rather than the fusion that occurs in a star.
In a thermonuclear supernova, the density and temperature in the star becomes so high that fusion of heavier elements ignites, starting with carbon and oxygen as 'fuel', and fusing heavier and heavier elements.""",07/22/2020

"Qatar Airways sues, seeks $5B from boycotting countries","DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Long-haul carrier Qatar Airways said Wednesday it launched international arbitration seeking at least $5 billion from four boycotting Arab countries for blocking its flights from their airspace and their markets, years into a simmering political dispute between the nations.
“The decision by the blockading states to prevent Qatar Airways from operating in their countries and flying over their airspace is a clear breach of civil aviation conventions and several binding agreements they are signatories to,” Qatar Airways CEO Akbar al-Baker said in a statement.
Egyptian state media and officials did not immediately acknowledge Qatar Airways' comments.
The four Arab nations cut ties with Qatar in 2017 in a political dispute fueled in part over Doha's support for Islamist groups that they view as terrorists.
